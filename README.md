# Hampshire Vets League Results

This was started to look at options to host results from a legacy HTML website that was moved to Wordpress.

This repo contains the results back to 2014 converted to Markdown, plus a zipped version of results from the old website going back to 1999 that can be downloaded and viewed locally if required.
